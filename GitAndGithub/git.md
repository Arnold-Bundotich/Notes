# GIT

A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project.  Its strengths are:

* Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.

* Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.

* Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.

Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git [1].

**Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called .git located in the root directory of the repository.**

## **Git Commands**

## 1. Repository Status

Displays the list of files that have been changed since the last commit.
These file are called un-staged files.

**Command:**

    git status

* Red means un-staged files.
* Green means staged or unchanged files.

## 2. Difference between current and previous changes

Shows the difference between the previous staged state and current un-staged state.

**Command:**

    git diff <filename/directory>
    git diff -r HEAD path/to/file

Here `-r` means compare to particular version and HEAD is the version before the change.

## 3. Stage Changes

The first step to store is to stage the changes.

**Command:**

    git add <filename>
    git add . //all files

## 4. Committing Changes

To save the changes in the staging area, you use the command:

    git commit -m "Message"

The above line writes a single line message. However in order to write more detail information run `git commit` and write.

## 5. History

Git allows you to view your previous commits.

    git log
    git log --oneline
    git log filename

The first shows all the commits with all details. The second compresses the detail in one line. The third shows the changes that occurred only in that file.

**Note :** The most recent commits are at the top.

Each Commit has a unique hash.
