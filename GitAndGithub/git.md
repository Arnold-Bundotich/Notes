# GIT

A version control system is a tool that manages changes made to the files and directories in a project.  Its strengths are:

* Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.

* Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.

* Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.

Version control isn't just for software: books, papers, parameter sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored and shared using something like Git [1].

**Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called .git located in the root directory of the repository.**

## **Git Commands**

## 1. Repository Status

Displays the list of files that have been changed since the last commit.
These file are called unstaged files.

**Command:**

    git status

* Red means unstaged files.
* Green means staged or unchanged files.

## 2. Difference between current and previous changes

Shows the difference between the previous staged state and current unstaged state.

**Command:**

    git diff <filename/directory>
    git diff -r HEAD path/to/file

Here `-r` means compare to particular version and HEAD is the version before the change.

## 3. Stage Changes

The first step to store is to stage the changes.

**Command:**

    git add <filename>
    git add . //all files

## 4. Commiting Changes

To save the changes in the staging area, you use the command:

    git commit -m "Message"
